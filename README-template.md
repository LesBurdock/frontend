## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind

### What I learned

I learnt about positioning in CSS using position absolute and relative as well as transform:translate to center divs.
I had a problem sizing the div and setting a height and width using tailwind as it did not provide a custom solution to the exact size I needed. I used CSS classes to apply my own custom CSs in this case. 
I learnt about reponsive design in tailwind and how to apply a grid-column for large screens and grid row approach for small screens.
I learnt about alignment and the box model as well as aligning items and icons in a list. adding a <p> tag inside a list element to allow for additional styles to be applied.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
